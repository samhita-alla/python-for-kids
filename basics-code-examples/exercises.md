# First Exercise
1. Fetch the type of an integer, string, and boolean variable.
2. Initialize a list with the names of five cars. Add one car to it. Delete one car from it and return the deleted car’s index.
3. Prompt the user to input and print the output to the console.
4. Tossing a Dice:
    1. Write an if-else statement(s) to print the dice number from 1 to 6.
    2. Take input from the user and print the statement enclosed in if-else. 
    3. For example, if the user gives the number 1, you’ll have to print “The number is 1”.
5. Understand the various list methods - pop(), remove(), insert(), len(), etc.
6. Difference between list and tuple.
7. Initialise a nested list such as list = [1, 2, [3, 4]] and update it to the number that the user gives. The final list has to be, `list = [1, 2, [3, 4, 5]] `when `5` is the number given by the user. Finally, print the updated list to the console.

# Second Exercise
1. Write a function, `add_it_up()`, that takes a single integer as input and returns the sum of the integers from zero to the input parameter. The function should return 0 if a non-integer is given.
2. Accept a string input from the user and print the reversed string.
3. Given three strings, string1 = "Filet Mignon", string2 = "Brisket ", and string3 = "Cheeseburger ", strip the left, right, and (left and right) empty space using Python code.
4. Check if the string, string = "Snowflake", starts with the word "Snow".
5. Replace every occurrence of the character "s" with "x" in the given string, phrase = "Somebody said something to Samantha.".
6. Try to find an upper-case "X" in user input.
7. Initialize a dictionary with three keys ("Enterprise", "Voyager", "Defiant") and three values ("Picard", "Janeway", "Sisko") respectively. Check if "Enterprise" and "Discovery" exist; if not, add them. Display the contents of the dictionary, one pair at a time. Remove "Discovery". 
8. Create a dictionary by passing a list to `dict()`.
9. Print the integer 2 through 10 using a "while" loop to the console. The output must be: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Important: You'll have to print the commas as well and notice the full stop in the end (hint: you can use an `if` condition to check if the number is 10, and thereby, print the full stop).
10. Initialize two variables (weight = 0.2, animal = "newt”). Print the sentence "{weight} is the weight of the {animal}." using the below three techniques:
    1. Concatenate a number and a string in one print statement. 
    2. Use format() to print a number and a string inside of another string.
    3. Use formatted string literal (f-string) to reference objects inside a string
11. Print the number 1.147 as 3 to the power of 0.125
12. Check if the number 11.19 is an integer.
13. Round the number 4.179384238 to two decimal places.
14. Display all the factors of a number chosen by the user. For example, if the number given by the user is 10, the factors would be 1, 2, 5, 10. Print the numbers onto separate lines using the print() statement.
15. Display (Print) every number from 1 through 50 except multiples of 3.
16. Get the quotient when a dividend and divisor are given. For example, if the dividend is 10 and the divisor is 5, print the number 2.
17. Given a list of universities,
universities = [
    ["California Institute of Technology", 2175, 37704],
    ["Harvard", 19627, 39849],
    ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", 10566, 40732],
    ["Princeton", 7802, 37000],
    ["Rice", 5879, 35551],
    ["Stanford", 19535, 40569],
    ["Yale", 11701, 40500],
]
where the first entry is the university name, the second entry is the number of students, and the third entry is the tuition fee
    1. Return the mean value of the total tuition fee across all the universities (hint: mean here is the typical mean wherein the sum is to be divided by length. Sum here is the total of all tuition fees, and length is the number of entries in the universities list)
    2. Return the mean value of the total number of students across all the universities
18. Get principal amount, rate of interest, and time (years) and compute simple interest. (Simple Interest = (Principal Amount * Time * Rate of Interest)/100). Round the output to three decimal values.
